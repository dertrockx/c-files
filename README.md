# C programs

* Why? well, you see I'm still studying in UPLB, and in one of our subject ( or course, whatever you call it) we will use C as the main language for the entire semester. 
* In this repository, you'll find my programs I created when I was preparing for this semester ( because I prefer that I know the topic beforehand. )
* You can fork this, clone it, or even nuke it ( I'm joking :P ).
